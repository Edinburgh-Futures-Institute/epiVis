In 2016–2017, France experienced a devastating epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8, with more than 400 outbreaks reported in poultry farms. We analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of the epidemic using a structured-coalescent- based phylodynamic approach that combined viral genomic data (n = 196; one viral genome per farm) and epidemiological data. In the process, we estimated viral migra- tion rates between départements (French administrative regions) and the temporal dynamics of the effective viral population size (Ne) in each département. Viral migra- tion rates quantify viral spread between départements and Ne is a population genetic measure of the epidemic size and, in turn, is indicative of the within-département trans- mission intensity. We extended the phylodynamic analysis with a generalized linear model to assess the impact of multiple factors—including large-scale preventive culling and live-duck movement bans—on viral migration rates and Ne. We showed that the large-scale culling of ducks that was initiated on 4 January 2017 significantly reduced the viral spread between départements. No relationship was found between the viral spread and duck movements between départements. The within-département transmis- sion intensity was found to be weakly associated with the intensity of duck movements within départements. Together, these results indicated that the virus spread in short distances, either between adjacent départements or within départements. Results also suggested that the restrictions on duck transport within départements might not have stopped the viral spread completely. Overall, we demonstrated the usefulness of phy- lodynamics in characterizing the dynamics of a HPAI epidemic and assessing control measures. This method can be adapted to investigate other epidemics of fast-evolving livestock pathogens.",2022,"Edgar, 2004; Kumar et al., 2018; Martin et al., 2015; Minh et al., 2020; Guindon et al., 2010; Fourment and Holmes, 2015; Si et al., 2017; Rambaut et al., 2016; MASCOT; Müller et al., 2018; J.

Since 2014, Europe has been severely hit by several HPAI epidemics, with France being the most affected country. Most recently, France was again affected by two devastating HPAI epidemics in 2020-21 and 2021-22. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the 2020-21 and 2021-22 epidemics, as a first step towards identifying the poultry sector's remaining vulnerabilities regarding HPAI viruses in France. We examined the spatio-temporal distribution of outbreaks that occurred in France in 2020-21 and 2021-22, and we assessed the outbreaks' spatial distribution in relation to the 2016-17 epidemic and to the two 'high-risk zones' recently incorporated into French legislation to strengthen HPAI prevention and control. There were 468 reported outbreaks during the 2020-21 epidemic and 1375 outbreaks during the 2021-22 epidemic. In both epidemics, the outbreaks' distribution matched extremely well that of 2016-17, and most outbreaks (80.6% and 68.4%) were located in the two high-risk zones. The southwestern high-risk zone was affected in both epidemics, while the western high-risk zone was affected for the first time in 2021-22, explaining the extremely high number of outbreaks reported. As soon as the virus reached the high-risk zones, it started to spread between farms at very high rates, with each infected farm infecting between two and three other farms at the peaks of transmission. We showed that the spatial distribution model used to create the two high-risk zones was able to predict the location of outbreaks for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 epidemics. These zones were characterized by high poultry farm densities; future efforts should, therefore, focus on reducing the density of susceptible poultry in highly dense areas.",2022,"Guinat et al. 2019; Kamvar et al., 2019; Jombart et al., 2020; Tennekes, 2018; Obadia et al., 2012; Boelle and Obadia, 2015;Wallinga and Teunis, 2004; White and Pagano, 2008; Cori, 2021; ","1 (Guinat et al. 2019 spatial data; Wallinga and Teunis, 2004 & White and Pagano, 2008 method to calculate the effective reproduction number Re between farms)",HPAI,H5N8; H5N1,2020–2021; 2021–2022; 2016–2017 ,2020–21; 2021–22; 2016–17 ,HPAI H5N8 2020–21; HPAI H5N1 2021–22; HPAI H5N8 2016–17 ,France,"Two ‘high-risk zones’ (HRZs) were also incorpo- rated into French legislation in September 2021 (DGAl, 2021), ",1,"[Guinat et al, 2019: Poisson Boosted regression tree (BRT) models] ",,"To examine the spatio-temporal distribution of outbreaks that occurred in France in 2020–21 and 2021–22, and assess the outbreaks’ spatial distribution in relation to the 2016–17 epidemic and to the two ‘high-risk zones’ recently incorporated into French legislation to strengthen HPAI prevention and control.

Of particular importance are wild waterfowl, which are the primary reservoir of low-pathogenicity influenza viruses that ultimately cause high-pathogenicity outbreaks in poultry farms. Despite much work on the drivers of influenza A virus prevalence, the underlying viral subtype dynamics are still mostly unexplored. Nevertheless, understanding these dynamics, particularly for the agriculturally significant H5 and H7 subtypes, is important for mitigating the risk of outbreaks in domestic poultry farms. Here, using an expansive surveillance database, we take a large-scale look at the spatial, temporal, and taxonomic drivers in the prevalence of these two subtypes among influenza A-positive wild waterfowl. We document spatiotemporal trends that are consistent with past work, particularly an uptick in H5 viruses in late autumn and H7 viruses in spring. Interestingly, despite large species differences in temporal trends in overall influenza A virus prevalence, we document only modest differences in the relative abundance of these two subtypes and little, if any, temporal differences among species. As such, it appears that differences in species' phenology, physiology, and behaviors that influence overall susceptibility to influenza A viruses play a much lesser role in relative susceptibility to different subtypes. Instead, species are likely to freely pass viruses among each other regardless of subtype.

However, outbreaks of AI have been reported in the summer, including the breeding season of waterfowl. Additionally, the spatial distribution of waterfowl can easily change during the annual cycle due to their life- cycle traits and the presence of both migrants and residents in the population. Thus, we assessed the spatiotemporal variation in AI exposure risk in poultry due to spa- tial distribution changes in three duck species included in both major residents and wintering migrants in South Korea, the mandarin, mallard and spot-billed duck, during wintering (October–March), breeding (April–June) and whole annual seasons. To esti- mate seasonal ecological niche variations among the three duck species, we applied pairwise ecological niche analysis using the Pianka index. Subsequently, seasonal dis- tribution models were projected by overlaying the monthly ranges estimated by the maximum entropy model. Finally, we overlaid each seasonal distribution range onto a poultry distribution map of South Korea. We found that the mandarin had less niche overlap with the mallard and spot-billed duck during the wintering season than during the breeding season, whereas the mallard had less niche overlap with the mandarin and spot-billed duck during the breeding season than during the wintering season. Breeding and annual distribution ranges of the mandarin and spot-billed duck, but not the mallard, were similar or even wider than their wintering ranges. Similarly, the mandarin and spot-billed duck showed more extensive overlap proportions between poultry and their distributional ranges during both the breeding and annual seasons than during the wintering season. These results suggest that potential AI exposure in poultry can occur more widely in the summer than in winter, depending on sympa- try with the host duck species.

In a continental or global view, the study of virus movements within and across flyways is important to understanding virus diversity, evolution, and movement. From 2015 to 2017, we sampled waterfowl from breeding (Maine) and wintering (Maryland) areas within the Atlantic Flyway (AF) along the east coast of North America to investigate the spatio-tem- poral trends in persistence and spread of influenza A viruses (IAV). We isolated 109 IAVs from 1,821 cloacal / oropharyngeal samples targeting mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American black ducks (Anas rubripes), two species having ecological and conservation importance in the flyway that are also host reservoirs of IAV. Isolates with >99% nucleotide similarity at all gene segments were found between eight pairs of birds in the northern site across years, indicating some degree of stability among genome constellations and the pos- sibility of environmental persistence. No movement of whole genome constellations were identified between the two parts of the flyway, however, virus gene flow between the north- ern and southern study locations was evident. Examination of banding records indicate direct migratory waterfowl movements between the two locations within an annual season, providing a mechanism for the inferred viral gene flow. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses pro- vided evidence for virus dissemination from other North American wild birds to AF dabbling ducks (Anatinae), shorebirds (Charidriformes), and poultry (Galliformes). Evidence was found for virus dissemination from shorebirds to gulls (Laridae), and dabbling ducks to shorebirds and poultry. The findings from this study contribute to the understanding of IAV ecology in waterfowl within the AF.

Generally, the new variant of the HPAI virus crossed into various countries through wild bird migration, and persisted in the local environment through the interactions between wild and farmed birds. Nevertheless, no studies have found informative cases associated with connecting local persistence and long- range dispersal. During the 2016–2017 HPAI H5N6 epidemic in South Korea, we observed several waterfowls with avian influenza infection under telemetric monitoring. Based on the telemetry records and surveillance data, we conducted a case study to test hypotheses related to the transmission pathway between wild birds and poultry. One sedentary wildfowl naturally infected with HPAI H5N6, which overlapped with the home range of one migratory bird with H5-specific antibody- positive, showed itself to be phylogenetically close to the isolates from a chicken farm located within its habitat.

to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8. To do so, we used a spatially-explicit transmission model, which was calibrated to reproduce the observed spatio-temporal distribution of outbreaks in France during the 2016–2017 epidemic of HPAI. Six scenarios were investigated, in which the density of palmiped farms was decreased in the municipalities with the highest palmiped farm density. For each of the six scenarios, we first calculated the spatial dis- tribution of the basic reproduction number (R0), i.e. the expected number of farms a particular farm would be likely to infect, should all other farms be susceptible. We also ran in silico simulations of the adjusted model for each scenario to estimate epidemic sizes and time-varying effective reproduction numbers. We showed that reducing palmiped farm density in the densest municipalities decreased substantially the size of the areas with high R0 values (> 1.5). In silico simulations suggested that reducing palmiped farm density, even slightly, in the densest municipalities was expected to decrease substantially the number of affected poultry farms and therefore provide benefits to the poultry sector as a whole. However, they also suggest that it would not have been sufficient, even in combination with the intervention measures implemented during the 2016–2017 epidemic, to completely prevent the virus from spread- ing.

A risk assessment model that precisely predicts high-risk groups and occurrence of HPAI infection is essential for effective biosecurity measures that minimize the socio- economic losses of massive outbreaks. However, the conventional risk prediction approaches have difficulty incorporating the broad range of factors associated with HPAI infections at poultry holdings. Therefore, it is difficult to accommodate the complexity of the dynamic transmission mechanisms and generate risk estimation on a real-time basis. We proposed a continuous risk prediction framework for HPAI occur- rences that used machine learning algorithms (MLAs). This integrated environmental, on-farm biosecurity, meteorological, vehicle movement tracking, and HPAI wild bird surveillance data to improve accuracy and timeliness. This framework consisted of (i) the generation of 1788 predictors from six types of data and reconstructed them with an outcome variable into a data mart based on a temporal assumption (i.e. infected period and day-ahead forecasting); (ii) training of the predictors with the temporally rearranged outcome variable that corresponded to HPAI H5N6 infected state at each individual farm on daily basis during the 2016–2017 HPAI epidemic using three different MLAs [Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and eXtreme Gra- dient Boosting]; (iii) predicting the daily risk of HPAI infection during the 2017–2018 HPAI epidemic using the pre-trained MLA models for each farm across the country. The models predicted the high risk to 8–10 out of 19 infected premises during the infected period in advance. The GBM MLAs outperformed the 7-day forecasting of HPAI prediction at individual poultry holdings, with an area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic of 0.88. Therefore, this approach enhances the flexibility and timing of interventions against HPAI outbreaks at poultry farms.

More recently, these subtypes of HPAI virus resurged and spread nationwide, heavily impacting the entire poultry production and supply system. Most outbreaks in poultry holdings were concentrated in the southwestern part of the country, accounting for 58.3% of the total occurrences. This geographically persistent occurrence demanded the investigation of spatial risk factors related to the HPAI outbreak and the prediction of the risk of emerging HPAI outbreaks. Therefore, we investigated 12 spatial variables for the three subtypes of HPAI virus-infected premises [(IPs), 88 H5N1, 339 H5N8, and 335 H5N6 IPs]. Then, two prediction models using statistical and machine learning algorithm approaches were built from a case-control study on HPAI H5N8 epidemic, the most prolonged outbreak, in 339 IPs and 626 non-IPs. Finally, we predicted the risk of HPAI H5N1 and H5N6 occurrence at poultry farms using a Bayesian logistic regression and machine learning algorithm model [extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model] built on the case-control study. Several spatial variables showed similar distribution between two subtypes of IPs, although there were distinct heterogeneous distributions of spatial variables among the three IP subtypes. The case-control study indicated that the density of domestic duck farms and the minimum distance to live bird markets were leading risk factors for HPAI outbreaks. The two prediction models showed high predictive performance for H5N1 and H5N6 occurrences [an area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic of Bayesian model > 0.82 and XGBoost model > 0.97]. This finding emphasizes that spatial characteristics of the poultry farm play a vital role in the occurrence and forecast of HPAI outbreaks. Therefore, this finding is expected to contributing to developing prevention and control strategies.

Various mechanistic models have been developed in an attempt to better understand avian influenza transmission and to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures. However, no comprehensive review of the mechanistic approaches used currently exists. To help fill this gap, we conducted a systematic review of mechanistic models applied to real-world epidemics to (1) describe the type of models and their epidemiological context, (2) synthetise estimated values of AIV transmission parameters and (3) review the control strategies most frequently evaluated and their outcome. Fourty-five articles qualified for inclusion, that fitted the model to data and estimated parameter values (n = 42) and/or evaluated the effectiveness of control strategies (n = 21). The majority were population-based models (n = 26), followed by individual-based models (n = 15) and a few metapopulation models (n = 4). Estimated values for the transmission rate varied substantially according to epidemiological settings, virus subtypes and epidemiological units. Other parameters such as the durations of the latent and infectious periods were more frequently assumed, limiting the insights brought by mechanistic models on these. Concerning control strategies, many models evaluated culling (n = 15), while vaccination received less attention (n = 7). According to the reviewed articles, optimal control strategies varied between virus subtypes and local conditions, and also depended on the objective. For instance, vaccination was optimal when the objective was to limit the overall number of culled flocks, while pre-emptive culling was preferred for reducing the epidemic size and duration. Earlier implementation of interventions consistently improved the efficacy of control strategies, highlighting the need for effective surveillance and epidemic preparedness. Potential improvements of mechanistic models include explicitly accounting for various transmission routes, and distinguishing poultry populations according to species and farm type. To provide insights to policy makers in a timely manner, aspects about the evaluation of control 3 strategies that could deserve further attention include: economic evaluation, combination of strategies including vaccination, the use of optimization algorithm instead of comparing a limited set of scenarios, and real-time evaluation.

A total of 30H9N2 viruses were isolated from poultry and environmental specimens (years 2015–2020). Genome sequences of H9N2 viruses (2003-2020) from India were analyzed, revealing several substitutions. We found five reassortant genotypes. The HA, NA and PB2 genes belonged to the Middle-Eastern B sublineage; NP and M to the classical G1 lineage; PB1, PA and NS showed resemblance to genes from either HPAI-H7N3/H5N1 viruses. Molecular clock and phylogeography revealed that the introduction of all the genes to India took place around the year 2000.

Influenza surveillance","Influenza virus, with a global distribution, diverse animal host range and multiple virus subtypes, has caused several pandemics. To better prepare for the emergence of new subtypes and the possible threat of the next pandemic, the global status of animal influenza must be defined and documented. We created a global database of animal influenza events by searching scientific databases and the primary literature on animal influenza- related events up to and including 2016. The temporal, spatial and host distribution of animal influenza and the diversity of influenza subtypes in different regions were analyzed. A total of 70,472 records and 4712 events of animal influenza throughout the world were identified. Events involving subtypes H5N2, H7N7 and H7N9 were relatively constant, with a slow upward trend during the past decade. Asia was the region with the most clusters of events. Poultry was the main host reported in Asia and Africa, and wild birds in Europe and North America. We found that wild birds carried a very rich array of virus subtypes, a warning for the possible gen- eration of reassortment viruses with pandemic potential. Influenza virus subtype diversity - a risk for virus reassortment - was greatest in Asia, North America and Europe. Our database provides a comprehensive over- view of the historical and current status of animal influenza events throughout the world. Influenza surveillance needs to be strengthened in some countries and regions to prevent the emergence of new subtypes. Importantly, improvement of the global influenza surveillance system and structures to enable sharing of surveillance data is very much needed to prepare for the next pandemic.
