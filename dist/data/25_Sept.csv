However, outbreaks of AI have been reported in the summer, including the breeding season of waterfowl. Additionally, the spatial distribution of waterfowl can easily change during the annual cycle due to their life- cycle traits and the presence of both migrants and residents in the population. Thus, we assessed the spatiotemporal variation in AI exposure risk in poultry due to spa- tial distribution changes in three duck species included in both major residents and wintering migrants in South Korea, the mandarin, mallard and spot-billed duck, during wintering (October-March), breeding (April-June) and whole annual seasons. To esti- mate seasonal ecological niche variations among the three duck species, we applied pairwise ecological niche analysis using the Pianka index. Subsequently, seasonal dis- tribution models were projected by overlaying the monthly ranges estimated by the maximum entropy model. Finally, we overlaid each seasonal distribution range onto a poultry distribution map of South Korea. We found that the mandarin had less niche overlap with the mallard and spot-billed duck during the wintering season than during the breeding season, whereas the mallard had less niche overlap with the mandarin and spot-billed duck during the breeding season than during the wintering season. Breeding and annual distribution ranges of the mandarin and spot-billed duck, but not the mallard, were similar or even wider than their wintering ranges. Similarly, the mandarin and spot-billed duck showed more extensive overlap proportions between poultry and their distributional ranges during both the breeding and annual seasons than during the wintering season. These results suggest that potential AI exposure in poultry can occur more widely in the summer than in winter, depending on sympa- try with the host duck species. Future studies considering the population density and variable pathogenicity of AI are required.",2022,"Guevara et al., 2018; La Sala et al., 2019; Merow and Silander, 2014; Moriguchi et al., 2013; Phillips and Dud¡k, 2008; Seo et al., 2008; Walsh et al., 2017; Barbet-Massin et al., 2012; Liang et al., 2018; Ye et al., 2018; Swets, 1988; Azareh et al., 2019; Kreakie et al. 2012; Olivier and Wotherspoon, 2006; Zhang et al. 2017;",2,,HPAI,2014 to 2018 ,HPAI 2014 to 2018 ,South Korea,,1,Species distribution models,Maximum Entrophy Model (MaxEnt),,1,3,"occurrence data for these three duck species;

The fundamental prevention and control strategy for HPAI includes early detection and timely intervention enforcement through a systematic surveillance system for wild birds based on the ecological understanding of the dynamics of wild birds' movements. Our study aimed to develop a spatiotemporal risk assessment model for avian influenza (AI) infection in wild birds to empower surveil- lance information for a contingency strategy. For this purpose, first, we predicted the monthly habitat suitability of seven waterfowl species, using 227,671 Global Position- ing System (GPS) tracking records of 562 birds from 2014 to 2018 in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Then, that predicted habitat suitability and 421 coordinates of AI detec- tion sites in wild birds were used to build the risk assessment model. Subsequently, we compared the monthly predicted risk of avian influenza virus (AIv) identification in wild birds between case and non-case poultry farms with HPAI H5N6 outbreak in the ROK between 2016 and 2017. The results reported considerable variation of monthly habitat suitability of seven waterfowls and the impact of predicting AI occurrences in wild birds. The high habitat suitability for spot-billed ducks (contribution rate in November = 40.9%) and mallards (contribution rate in January = 34.3%) significantly contributed to predicting the average risk of AIv identification in wild birds, with high predictive performance [the monthly mean of area under the curve (AUC) = 0.978]. Moreover, our model showed that the averaged risk of identification AI in wild birds was significantly higher in HPAI infected premises, with infected domestic duck hold- ings exhibiting a significantly higher risk than the chicken farms in November. This study suggests that animal health authority establishes a risk-based HPAI surveillance system grounded on the ecological nature of wild birds to improve the effectiveness of prevention and preparedness of emerging epidemics.

Understanding the spatiotemporal outbreak characteristics and environmental factors of H5N1 outbreaks is of great significance for the estab- lishment of effective prevention and control systems. The time and location of H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and wild birds officially confirmed by the World Organization for Animal Health from 2005 to 2019 were collected. Spatial autocorrelation analysis and multidistance spatial agglomeration analysis methods were used to analyze the global outbreak sites of H5N1. Combined with remote sensing data, the correlation between H5N1 outbreaks and environmental factors was analyzed using binary logistic regression methods. We analyzed the correlation between the H5N1 outbreak and environmental factors and finally made a risk prediction for the global H5N1 outbreaks. The results show that the peak of the H5N1 outbreaks occurs in winter and spring. H5N1 outbreaks exhibit aggregation, and a weak aggregation phenomenon is noted on the scale close to 5000 km. Water distance, road distance, railway distance, wind speed, leaf area index (LAI), and specific humidity were protective factors for the outbreak of H5N1, and the odds ratio (OR) were 0.985, 0.989, 0.995, 0.717, 0.832, and 0.935, respectively. Temperature was a risk factor with an OR of 1.073. The significance of these ORs was greater than 95%. The global risk prediction map was obtained. Given that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading globally, the methods and results of this study can provide a reference for studying the spread of COVID-19.

To provide a better understanding of the distributional characteristics of HPAI H5N1 out- breaks in Egypt, this study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal pattern and identify clusters of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in Egypt from 2006 to 2017.
Results: The Epidemic curve (EC) was constructed through time series analysis; in which six epidemic waves (EWs) were revealed. Outbreaks mainly started in winter peaked in March and ended in summer. However, newly emerged thermostable clades (2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.2) during the 4th EW enabled the virus to survive and cause infection in warmer months with a clear alteration in the seasonality of the epidemic cycle in the 5th EW. The endemic situation became more complicated by the emergence of new serotypes. As a result, the EC ended up without any specific pattern since the 6th EW to now. The spatial analysis showed that the highest outbreak density was recorded in the Nile Delta considering it as the 'Hot spot' region. By the 6th EW, the outbreak extended to include the Nile valley. From spati- otemporal cluster epidemics, clustering in the Delta was a common feature in all EWs with primary clusters consist- ently detected in the hot-spot region, but the location and size varied with each EW. The highest Relative Risk (RR) regions in an EW were noticed to contain the primary clusters of the next EW and were found to include stopover sites for migratory wild birds. They were in Fayoum, Dakahlia, Qalyobiya, Sharkia, Kafr_Elsheikh, Giza, Behera, Menia, and BeniSuef governorates. Transmission of HPAI H5N1 occurred from one location to another directly resulted in a series of outbreaks forming neighboring secondary clusters. The absence of geographical borders between the gov- ernorates in addition to non-restricted movements of poultry and low vaccination and surveillance coverage contrib- uted to the wider spread of infection all over Egypt and to look like one epidemiological unit.

An understanding of viruses in wild reservoir species across time and space is important to informing surveillance programs, risk models, and potential population impacts for vulnerable species. Although it is recognized that influenza A virus prevalence peaks in reservoir waterfowl in late summer through autumn, temporal and spatial variation across species has not been fully characterized. We combined two large influenza databases for North America and applied spatiotemporal models to explore patterns in prevalence throughout the annual cycle and across the continental United States for 30 waterfowl species. Peaks in prevalence in late summer through autumn were pronounced for dabbling ducks in the genera Anas and Spatula, but not Mareca. Spatially, areas of high prevalence appeared to be related to regional duck density, with highest predicted prevalence found across the upper Midwest during early fall, though further study is needed. We documented elevated prevalence in late winter and early spring, particularly in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.

This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern, identify, and trace the highest risk clusters of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks at the subdistrict/village level in Menoa governorate, from 2006 to 2017 as a trial for tracking the HPAI H5N1 endemicity dynamics for better establishment of effective disease control strategies at that level. Results: The epidemic curve in Menoa was similar to the national curve. Although the poultry population in Menoa was affected earlier than other places, the 1st Epidemic Wave (EW) started one week after the initial outbreak in Egypt, the HPAI H5N1 outbreaks never initiated from Menoa in all EWs. The outbreaks' spatial risk increases at the northern governorate border with a decrease in the spatial risk by the 6th EW. The hot spot region in Menoa was found in rural districts, especially villages, while outbreak density decreased with increased urbanization. Observed smoothed densities describe epidemic spread dynamics where the infection spreads and connects many different locations inside the same city, before jumping to new areas and directly connecting the nearest neighbor cities. The primary clusters could be predicted since they occur in the same areas where the highest relative risk clusters were recorded in the previous wave. Identifying continuous pinpointing clusters that persist for a long time, possibly spanning months, indicates the local transmission of the virus among poultry due to contact and widespread circulation. It is crucial to take early measures to prevent outbreaks at the initial sites before the outbreak acceleration phase, in order to minimize the geographic spread and conne the infection to specic areas. That suggests the need for the establishment of effective disease control strategies at the subdistrict level based on a better understanding of the endemicity dynamics.

","Highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b (hereafter H5N1) is causing vast impacts on biodiversity and poultry around the globe. In Chile it was first reported on December 7th, 2022, in a pelican (Pelecanus thagus) found dead in the northern city of Arica. In the following months, lethal H5N1 cases were reported in a wide range of wild bird species, marine mammals, backyard and industrial poultry, and in a human. Despite its high impact and spread, it is not well-known what environmental factors are associated with outbreaks. This study describes the spatio-temporal patterns of the current epizootic of H5N1 in Chile and test ecological and anthropogenic drivers that could be associated with outbreak occurrence. We used H5N1 cases reported by the Chilean national animal health authority to the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) from December 9th, 2022, to March 3rd, 2023. These included bird cases confirmed through avian influenza specific real-time PCR assay (qPCR), obtained from passive and active surveillance. Data was analyzed to detect the presence of H5N1 clusters under space-time permutation probability modelling, H5N1 association between distance and days since first outbreak through linear regression, and correlation between H5N1 presence with a range of ecological and anthropogenic variables by general linear modelling. From the 197 H5N1 identified outbreaks, involving 478 individual cases among wild and domestic birds, a wave-like steady spread of H5N1 from north to south was identified, that can help predict hotspots of outbreak risk and establish targeted preventive measures. For instance, 14 statistically significant clusters were identified, with the largest located in central Chile (18-29 km in radius) where poultry production is concentrated. Also, one of the clusters was identified in Tocopilla, location where the H5N1 human case occurred time later. In addition, the presence of H5N1 outbreaks was positively correlated with bird richness, human footprint, precipitation of the wettest month, minimum temperature of the coldest month, and mean diurnal temperature. In contrast, presence of H5N1 was negatively correlated to distance to the closest urban center, precipitation seasonality and isothermality. Preventive actions based on our modeling approach include developing wildlife surveillance diagnostic capabilities in Chilean regions concentrating outbreaks. It is urgent that scientists, the poultry sector, local communities and national health

At the beginning of 2016, the H9N2 Avian influenza virus (AIV) was detected in Morocco for the first time; despite the implementation of vaccination strategies to control the disease, the virus has become endemic in poultry in the country. The present study was carried out to investigate the origins, zoonotic potential, as well as the impact of vaccination on the molecular evolution of Moroccan H9N2 viruses. Twenty-eight (28) H9N2 viruses collected from 2016 to 2021 in Moroccan poultry flocks were isolated and their whole genomes sequenced. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses showed that Moroccan H9N2 viruses belong to the G1-like lineage and are closely related to viruses isolated in Africa and the Middle East. A high similarity among all the 2016-2017 hemagglutinin sequences was observed, while the viruses identified in 2018-2019 and 2020-2021 were separated from their 2016-2017 ancestors by long branches. Mutations in the HA protein associated with antigenic drift and increased zoonotic potential were also found. The Bayesian phylogeographic analyses revealed the Middle East as being the region where the Moroccan H9N2 virus may have originated, before spreading to the other African countries. Our study is the first comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary history of the H9N2 viruses in the country, highlighting their zoonotic potential and pointing out the importance of implementing effective monitoring systems.

To understand the spread and evolution process of the virus, a spatial and temporal Bayesian evolutionary analysis was conducted on 2,052 H7N9 viruses isolated during 2013 and 2018. It revealed that the H7N9 virus was probably emerged in a border area of Anhui Province in August 2012, approximately 6 months earlier than the first human case reported. Two major epicenters had been developed in the Yangtze River Delta and Peral River Delta regions by the end of 2013, and from where the viruses have also spread to other regions at an average speed of 6.57 km/d. At least 24 genotypes showing have been developed and each of them showed a distinct spatio-temporal distribution pattern. Furthermore, A random forest algorithm-based model has been developed to predict the occurrence risk of H7N9 virus. The model has a high overall forecasting precision (> 97%) and the monthly H7N9 occurrence risk for each county of China was predicted. These findings provide new insights for a comprehensive understanding of the origin, evolution, and occurrence risk of H7N9 virus. Moreover, our study also lays a theoretical basis for conducting risk-based surveillance and prevention of the disease.

Influenza surveillance","Influenza virus, with a global distribution, diverse animal host range and multiple virus subtypes, has caused several pandemics. To better prepare for the emergence of new subtypes and the possible threat of the next pandemic, the global status of animal influenza must be defined and documented. We created a global database of animal influenza events by searching scientific databases and the primary literature on animal influenza- related events up to and including 2016. The temporal, spatial and host distribution of animal influenza and the diversity of influenza subtypes in different regions were analyzed. A total of 70,472 records and 4712 events of animal influenza throughout the world were identified. Events involving subtypes H5N2, H7N7 and H7N9 were relatively constant, with a slow upward trend during the past decade. Asia was the region with the most clusters of events. Poultry was the main host reported in Asia and Africa, and wild birds in Europe and North America. We found that wild birds carried a very rich array of virus subtypes, a warning for the possible gen- eration of reassortment viruses with pandemic potential. Influenza virus subtype diversity - a risk for virus reassortment - was greatest in Asia, North America and Europe. Our database provides a comprehensive over- view of the historical and current status of animal influenza events throughout the world. Influenza surveillance needs to be strengthened in some countries and regions to prevent the emergence of new subtypes. Importantly, improvement of the global influenza surveillance system and structures to enable sharing of surveillance data is very much needed to prepare for the next pandemic.

We documented 11 wild waterfowl (three Anatidae species) in or near eight commercial livestock facilities in Washington and California with GPS telemetry data. Wild ducks used dairy and beef cattle feed lots and facility retention ponds during both day and night suggesting use for roosting and foraging. Two individuals (single locations) were observed inside poultry facility bound- aries while using nearby wetlands. Ducks demonstrated high site fidelity, returning to the same areas of habitats (at livestock facilities and nearby wetlands), across months or years, showed strong connectivity with surrounding wetlands, and arrived from wet- lands up to 1251 km away in the week prior. Telemetry data provides substantial advan- tages over observational data, allowing assessment of individual movement behaviour and wetland connectivity that has significant implications for outbreak management. Telemetry improves our understanding of risk factors for waterfowl-livestock virus transmission and helps identify factors associated with coincident space use at the wild waterfowl-domestic livestock interface. Our research suggests that even rela- tively small or isolated natural and artificial water or food sources in/near facilities increases the likelihood of attracting waterfowl, which has important consequences for managers attempting to minimize or prevent AIV outbreaks. Use and interpretation of telemetry data, especially in near-real-time, could provide key information for reducing virus transmission risk between waterfowl and livestock, improving protective barriers between wild and domestic species, and abating outbreaks.

For the past 4 years, beginning in 2018, we have sampled a live-poultry market in Foshan, Guangdong, in this ongoing study. In addition to the prevalence of H9N2 avian influenza viruses in China during this period, we identified isolates from the same market belonging to clade A and clade B, which diverged in 2012-2013, and clade C, which diverged in 2014-2016, respectively. An analysis of population dynamics revealed that, after a critical divergence period from 2014 to 2016, the genetic diversity of H9N2 viruses peaked in 2017. Our spatiotemporal dynamics analysis found that clade A, B, and C, which maintain high rates of evolution, have different prevalence ranges and transmission paths. Clades A and B were mainly prevalent in East China in the early stage, and then spread to Southern China, becoming epidemic with clade C. Strains from different regions converge at the same live- poultry market to communicate, which may be one reasons the H9N2 viruses are difficult to eradicate and increasingly dominant throughout China. Selection pressure and molecular analysis have demonstrated that single amino acid polymorphisms at key receptor binding sites 156, 160, and 190 under positive selection pressure, suggesting that H9N2 viruses are undergoing mutations to adapt to new hosts. Live- poultry markets are important because people who visit them have frequent contact with poultry, H9N2 viruses from different regions converge at these markets and spread through contact between live birds and humans, generating increased risks of human exposure to these viruses and threatening public health safety. Thus, it is important to reducing the cross-regional trade of live poultry and strengthening the monitoring of avian influenza viruses in live-poultry markets to reduce the spread of avian influenza viruses.",2023,"Huang et al., 2010; Rambaut et al., 2016; Bielejec et al., 2016; Lemey et al., 2009;  Ji-Ming et al., 2022; Tamura et al., 2013; ",2,AI,H9N2,2012-2013; 2014-2016,"clade A and clade B, which diverged in 2012-2013 H9N2; clade C H9N2 in 2014-2016",China,,7,Phylogenetic analysis,Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC); a relaxed molecular clock model with uncorrelated log-normally distributed rates; a coalescent Bayesian skyline plot. ,,1,N/A,"clade B, clade C and clade D of H9N2 viral RNA",3,N/A,2,4,4,domestic birds,poultry,a Bayes factors (BFs) test,"no, unclear ",2; no limitations; yes similar studies,2; no impacts; no trade-offs; no opportunity costs; yes reasons for differences observed,2,no,2,yes,N/A,clear,unclear ,,no,no,not identified ,,unknown,Fill,unknown ,N/A?,1,neither variability nor uncertainty discussed ,no,no,no,no,no,,

The 2020-2021 season was the hitherto most devastating when considering bird numbers and duration in Europe. Surveillance data, virologic results and epidemiologic investigations from the 2020-2021 outbreaks in Sweden were analysed. Subtypes H5N8 and H5N5 were detected on 24 farms with poultry or other captive birds. In wild birds, subtypes H5N8, H5N5, H5N1, H5N4, H5Nx were detected in 130 out of 811 sampled birds. There was a spatiotemporal association between cases in wild birds and poultry. Based on phylogeny and epidemiology, most of the introductions of HPAI to commercial poultry were likely a result of indirect contact with wild birds. A definite route of introduction to poultry could not be established although some biosecurity breaches were observed. No spread between farms was identified but airborne spread between flocks on the same farm was suspected.

We isolated 22 H5N8 viruses from wild birds and 14 H5N8 viruses from waterfowls. Genetic analysis indicated that the 36 viruses formed two different genotypes: one genotype viruses were widely detected from different wild birds and domestic waterfowls; the other genotype was isolated from a whopper swan. We further revealed the origin and spatiotemporal spread of these two distinct H5N8 virus genotypes in 2020 and 2021. Animal studies indicated that the H5N8 isolates are highly pathogenic to chickens, mildly pathogenic in ducks, but have distinct pathotypes in mice.

However, the epidemiology of influenza is not well defined in this setting. We aimed to characterise influenza seasonality, examine regional heterogeneity in transmission, and evaluate coseasonality between circulating influenza viruses in Bangladesh.
Methods In this retrospective, time-series study, we used data collected between January, 2010, and December, 2019, from 32 hospital-based influenza surveillance sites across Bangladesh. We estimated influenza peak timing and intensity in ten regions using negative binomial harmonic regression models, and applied meta-analytic methods to determine whether seasonality differed across regions. Using live bird market surveillance data in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we estimated avian influenza seasonality and examined coseasonality between human and avian influenza viruses.
Findings Over the 10-year study period, we included 8790 human influenza cases and identified a distinct influenza season, with an annual peak in June to July each year (peak calendar week 27ú6, 95% CI 26ú7-28ú6). Epidemic timing varied by region (I2=93ú9%; p<0ú0001), with metropolitan regions peaking earlier and epidemic spread following a spatial diffusion pattern based on geographical proximity. Comparatively, avian influenza displayed weak seasonality, with moderate year-round transmission and a small peak in April (peak calendar week 14ú9, 95% CI 13ú2-17ú0), which was out of phase with influenza peaks in humans.
Interpretation In Bangladesh, influenza prevention and control activities could be timed with annual seasonality, and regional heterogeneity should be considered in health resource planning.

Based on official records, this study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of live broilers moved out of and within Guangxi in 2017. The yearly and monthly networks were analyzed for inter- and intra-provincial movements, respectively. Approximately 200,000 movements occurred in 2017, involving the transport of 200 million live broilers from Guangxi. Although Guangxi exported to 24 out of 32 provinces of China, 95% of inter-provincial movements occurred with three bordering provinces. Within Guangxi, counties were highly connected through the live broiler movements, creating conditions for rapid virus spreading throughout the province. Interestingly, a peak in movements during the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, late January in 2017, was not observed in this study, likely due to H7N9-related control measures constraining live bird trading. Both intra- and inter-provincial movements in March 2017 were significantly higher than in other months of that year, suggesting that dramatic price changes may influence the movement's network and reshape the risk pathways. However, despite these variations, the same small proportion of counties (less than 20%) exporting/importing more than 90% of inter- and intra-provincial movements remains the same throughout the year. Interventions, particularly surveillance and improving biosecurity, targeted to those counties are thus likely to be more effective for avian influenza risk mitigation than implemented indiscriminately. Additionally, simulations further demonstrated that targeting counties according to their degree or betweenness in the movement network would be the most efficient way to limit disease transmission via broiler movements.

Of particular importance are wild waterfowl, which are the primary reservoir of low-pathogenicity influenza viruses that ultimately cause high-pathogenicity outbreaks in poultry farms. Despite much work on the drivers of influenza A virus prevalence, the underlying viral subtype dynamics are still mostly unexplored. Nevertheless, understanding these dynamics, particularly for the agriculturally significant H5 and H7 subtypes, is important for mitigating the risk of outbreaks in domestic poultry farms. Here, using an expansive surveillance database, we take a large-scale look at the spatial, temporal, and taxonomic drivers in the prevalence of these two subtypes among influenza A-positive wild waterfowl. We document spatiotemporal trends that are consistent with past work, particularly an uptick in H5 viruses in late autumn and H7 viruses in spring. Interestingly, despite large species differences in temporal trends in overall influenza A virus prevalence, we document only modest differences in the relative abundance of these two subtypes and little, if any, temporal differences among species. As such, it appears that differences in species' phenology, physiology, and behaviors that influence overall susceptibility to influenza A viruses play a much lesser role in relative susceptibility to different subtypes. Instead, species are likely to freely pass viruses among each other regardless of subtype. Importantly, despite the similarities among species documented here, individual species still may play important roles in moving viruses across large geographic areas or sustaining local outbreaks through their different migratory behaviors.",2023,"Bevins et al., 2014; USDA, 2017; Spackman et al., 2002; Spackman, 2020; Kent, Ramey, et al., 2022; Barker & Maclsaac, 2022; Cheng et al., 2020; Goovaerts, 2008; Rue et al., 2009; Harrison, 2015; Lindgren & Rue, 2015; Rue et al., 2009; Riebler et al., 2012; Hooten and Hobbs, 2015; ",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used Moran's I, Geary's C, Getis-Ord Gi*, and a space-time permutation model to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of H5N1 outbreaks. We used Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to generate a time-scaled maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree. Our study revealed nine HPAI H5N1 epizootic waves between 2007 and 2020 that invariably peaked in the wintertime. After vaccination of poultry against H5N1 was introduced in 2012, the incidence of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks and poultry mortality decreased signifcantly over time. Nonetheless, our research revealed that the virus continued circulating unabatedly in Bangladesh. Te various spatiotemporal analyses were identifed up to nine space-time clusters across Bangladesh, with the most signifcant clustering and hotspots of H5N1 outbreaks in and around the district of Dhaka. Since 2007, four H5N1 clades have been detected in Bangladesh, with only clade 2.3.2.1a continuing to circulate since 2011, which was followed up by the reassorted clade 2.3.2.1a in 2012. Te HA gene of the H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1a has been reassorted into at least nine subgroups (R1-R9). After 2016, the frst eight groups disappeared, with only the R9 group remaining. Spatiotemporal patterns and phylodynamics of H5N1 outbreaks are crucial for developing targeted and appropriate HPAI control and prevention measures.

Generally, the new variant of the HPAI virus crossed into various countries through wild bird migration, and persisted in the local environment through the interactions between wild and farmed birds. Nevertheless, no studies have found informative cases associated with connecting local persistence and long- range dispersal. During the 2016-2017 HPAI H5N6 epidemic in South Korea, we observed several waterfowls with avian influenza infection under telemetric monitoring. Based on the telemetry records and surveillance data, we conducted a case study to test hypotheses related to the transmission pathway between wild birds and poultry. One sedentary wildfowl naturally infected with HPAI H5N6, which overlapped with the home range of one migratory bird with H5-specific antibody- positive, showed itself to be phylogenetically close to the isolates from a chicken farm located within its habitat. Our study is the first observational study that provides scientific evidence supporting the hypothesis that the HPAI spillover into poultry farms is caused by local persistence in sedentary birds, in addition to its long-range dispersal by sympatric migratory birds.

of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus at the human-live bird
market interface in China",Phylodynamics | avian influenza | live bird markets | transmission | spill-over,"In 2013 to 2017, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus has caused five severe epidemic waves of human infections in China. The role of live bird markets (LBMs) in the transmis- sion dynamics of H7N9 remains unclear. Using a Bayesian phylodynamic approach, we shed light on past H7N9 transmission events at the human-LBM interface that were not directly observed using case surveillance data-based approaches. Our results reveal concurrent circulation of H7N9 lineages in Yangtze and Pearl River Delta regions, with evidence of local transmission during each wave. Our results indicate that H7N9 circulated in humans and LBMs for weeks to months before being first detected. Our findings support the seasonality of H7N9 transmission and suggest a high number of underreported infections, particularly in LBMs. We provide evidence for differences in virus transmissibility between low and highly pathogenic H7N9. We demonstrate a regional spatial structure for the spread of H7N9 among LBMs, highlighting the importance of further investigating the role of local live poultry trade in virus transmission. Our results provide estimates of avian influenza virus (AIV) transmission at the LBM level, providing a unique opportunity to better prepare surveillance plans at LBMs for response to future AIV epidemics.",2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
